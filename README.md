# Epazote ðŸŒ¿
Microservices supervisor

## Why ?
There are good supervisors,
[daemontools](https://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html),
[runit](http://smarden.org/runit/) just to mention some, on most cases is just
a matter of uploading code to the server, create a run script and you are all
set, your code will start up and live forever, so far so good, but let's face
it, "stuff happens", suddenly the site or application can stop responding
request, display unwanted content, etc. here is where **Epazote** comes into
action.

## The problem to solve
Once your site/application is up and running, it can become idle and
unresponsive, your supervisor will not notice this, since in most of the cases
is just responsible for keeping your App process up and running no matter how it
is behaving, therefore exists the need to monitor the status of the application
and based on the responses take actions.

When doing Continuous Deployment "[CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)"
if the ping, healthcheck, status, etc; endpoints change, it implies making changes
in order to properly monitor the application, this creates a dependency or extra
task apart from the "CD" process, therefore exists the need to detect any changes
and automatically apply them upon request.

## How it works
In its basic way of operation, **Epazote** periodically checks the services endpoints
"[URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator)"
by doing an [HTTP GET Request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods),
based on the response [Status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes),
[Headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields) or
either the
[body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_message_body), it executes a command.

In most scenarios, is desired to apply a command directly to the application in
cause, like a signal (``kill -HUP``), or either a restart (``sv restart app``),
therefore in this case **Epazote** and the application should be running on the
same server.

**Epazote** can also work in a standalone mode by only monitoring and sending
alerts if desired.

# How to use it
First you need to install **Epazote**, either you can compile it from
[source](https://github.com/nbari/epazote)
or download a pre-compiled binary matching your operating system.

> To compile from source, after downloading the sources use ``make`` to build the binary

**Epazote** was designed with simplicity in mind, as an easy tool for
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and as a complement to
infrastructure orchestration tools like [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) and
[SaltStack](http://saltstack.com/), because of this [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/)
is used for the configuration files, avoiding with this, the learn of a new
language or syntax, and simplifying the setup.

## The configuration file

The configuration file ([YAML formated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML))
consists of two parts, a **config** and a **services** (Key-value pairs).

## The config section

The **config** section is composed of three settings:

    - post (Url to post the logs)
    - smtp (Email settings for sending notification)
    - scan (Paths used to find the file 'epazote.yml')

Example:

```yaml
config:
    post: http://domain.tld/get/json/
    smtp:
        username: smtp@domain.tld
        password: password
        server: mail.example.com
        port: 587
        headers:
            from: epazote@domain.tld
            to: team@domain.tld ops@domain.tld etc@domain.tld
            subject: [%s -%s], Service, Status
    scan:
        paths:
            - /arena/home/sites
            - /home/apps
        minutes: 5
```

### config - post

An URL to post all activity related to the services if log is enable on the
service. The **post** setting is optional.

### config - smtp

Required to properly send alerts via email, all fields are required, the
``headers`` section can be extended with any desired key-pair values.

### config - scan

Paths to scan every N ``seconds``, ``minutes`` or ``hours``, a search for
services specified in a file call ``epazote.yml`` is made.

The **scan** setting is optional however is very useful when doing Continues
Deployments. for example if your code is automatically uploaded to the
directory ``/arena/home/sites/application_1`` and your scan paths contain
``/arena/home/sites``, you could simple upload on your application directory a
file named ``epazote.yml`` with the service rules, thus achieving the deployment
of your application and the supervising at the same time.

### config (optional)

As you may notice the ``config`` section contains mainly settings for sending
alerts/notifications apart from the ``scan`` setting, therefore is totally
optional, meaning that **Epazote** can still run and check your services without
the need of the ``config`` section.

If you want to automatically update/load services you will need the
``config - scan`` setting.


## The services section

Services are the main functionality of **Epazote**, is where the URL's and the
rules based on the response are defined.

TODO....

```yaml
services:
    my service 1:
        url: http://myservice.domain.tld/_healthcheck_
        timeout: 5
        seconds: 60
        log: True
        expect:
            status: 200
            header:
                content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
            body: find this string on my site
        if_not:
            cmd: sv restart /services/my_service_1
            notify: team@domain.tld
            msg: |
                line 1 bla bla
                line 2
        if_status:
            500:
                cmd: reboot
            404:
                cmd: sv restart /services/cache
                msg: restarting cache
                notify: team@domain.tld x@domain.tld
        if_header:
            x-amqp-kapputt:

                    The rabbit is angry
                    & hungry
            x-db-kapputt:
                cmd: svc restart /services/db

    other service:
        url: http://other-service.domain.tld/ping
        minutes: 3

    redirect service:
        url: http://test.domain.tld/
        hour: 1
        expect:
            status: 302
        if_not:
            cmd: service restart abc
            notify: abc@domain.tld
